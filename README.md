# DailyPlanner
A simple calendar application powered by JQuery

# Background 

This is my first attempt at building a calendar app, incorporating the following elements:
1. HTML
2. CSS 
3. jQuery 

## Code Style

This website is built with HTML and CSS code, with the primary code created using jQuery 

## Functionality

Daily planner to create a schedule:

WHEN user opens the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN user scrolls down
THEN user is presented with time blocks for standard business hours
WHEN user views the time blocks for that day
THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN user clicks into a time block
THEN they can enter an event
WHEN user clicks the save button for that time block
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN user refreshes the page
THEN the saved events persist
